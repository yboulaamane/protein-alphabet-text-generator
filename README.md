# 🧬 Protein Alphabet Text Generator

This Streamlit app renders text using protein-structure letters inspired by
real crystal structures.

Each letter corresponds to a folded protein whose 3D shape resembles a
typographic character, based on the work of:

> Howarth, M. (2015). *Say it with proteins: an alphabet of crystal structures*.  
> Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, 22(5), 349–349.
